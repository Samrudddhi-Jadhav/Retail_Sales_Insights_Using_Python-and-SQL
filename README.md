# 🟦 Project Title:

End-to-End Sales Data Analytics using Python and MySQL

# 📝 Description:

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics process — from data extraction to insights — using Python, Pandas, and MySQL.
The goal is to analyze sales data, clean and transform it, load it into a SQL database, and answer key business questions using SQL queries.

# 🔍 Project Workflow:

# Data Collection:
Downloaded dataset from Kaggle using Kaggle API.

Handled missing values using Pandas
Renamed columns and standardized data
Calculated new fields like discount, sale_price, and profit
Converted date columns and dropped unnecessary ones

# Data Loading (SQL):
Created database and table in MySQL
Loaded cleaned data into MySQL using SQLAlchemy

# Data Analysis (SQL):
Top 10 highest revenue-generating products
Top 5 products by region
Month-over-month sales comparison for 2022 vs 2023
Highest sales month per category
Sub-category with highest profit growth

# 📈 Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Zipfile, SQLAlchemy)
MySQL
Kaggle API
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

# 📊 Key Insights:
Identified best-selling products and profitable categories
Compared year-over-year growth trends
